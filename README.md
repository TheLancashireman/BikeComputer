# BikeComputer

A bike computer with a GPS receiver and an SD card slot for logging a GPS trace.

## Components

* An Arduino nano
* An LCD display module
* A GPS receiver module
* An SD card module

## Batron BTHQ 21605AV-YETF-LED04-I2C-5V LCD  (I2C, character set R)

LED current 90mA at 4.1v
Series resistor: R = V/I ==> R = 1v / 0.09 = 11 Ohm. 4*47 ohm in parallel?
